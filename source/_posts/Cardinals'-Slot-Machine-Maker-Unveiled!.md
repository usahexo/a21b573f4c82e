#  Cardinals' Slot Machine Maker Unveiled!

The St. Louis Cardinals have come out with a new, high-tech addition to their ballpark: a slot machine! The machine, made by the Illinois-based company JAXX, will be located in the stadium's Clubhouse Store and is sure to be a hit with fans.

The Cardinals announced their new partnership with JAXX on Tuesday. The company is best known for its slot machines, which are found in casinos across the country. Now, it will be bringing its games to Busch Stadium.

"JAXX is excited to partner with one of the most historic and beloved franchises in all of professional sports," said JAXX CEO Alex Solis. "This partnership provides us with a unique opportunity to connect with Cardinals fans and showcase our industry-leading gaming products."

 Cardinal Nation is certainly excited about the new addition, as well.

"I think it's great," said fan Randy Karraker. "It gives people another thing to do at the ballpark, and it's another way for the Cardinals to make money."

Karraker wasn't alone in his sentiments. Many other fans voiced their approval of the move on social media.

This isn't the first time that the Cardinals have partnered with JAXX, either. The two organizations teamed up back in 2013 when JAXX became the team's official gaming supplier.

The Cardinals have had some great players over the years, including Stan Musial, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson, and Ozzie Smith. They have also won a number of championships, including eleven World Series titles and seventeen NL pennants.

A big part of the Cardinals' success over the years has been their slot machines. Who manufactures these slot machines for the Cardinals? Let's take a look.

#  Cardinals Chosen for New Slot Machine Manufacturing Partnership!

Arizona Cardinals have been announced as the newest partner for Slot Machine Manufacturing!

The Cardinals will join the likes of the Detroit Lions, Los Angeles Rams and Pittsburgh Steelers as NFL squads with slot machines bearing their branding.

This is a huge step for the Cardinals, who are gearing up for a new stadium and want to create extra revenue streams for the franchise.

The games will be manufactured by IGT and will be available in casinos across America.

Cardinals President Michael Bidwill had this to say about the new venture: "We're excited to team up with IGT and provide our fans with an immersive casino experience that features our brand and some of the best players in the NFL."

Slot machines are big business in America, with revenues topping $10 billion annually. So it's no surprise that NFL teams are getting in on the action.

The Rams have already seen success with their slot machines, which are available at several casinos in Las Vegas.

The Steelers also have a deal in place for slot machines, which will be available at casinos in Pennsylvania.

#  Arizona Cardinals to Get New Slot Machine Manufacturer

For the upcoming season, the Arizona Cardinals have decided to switch slot machine manufacturers. They had been working with IGT for the past few seasons, but have now partnered with Bally Gaming.

Bally is a well-known manufacturer of slot machines, and Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill is confident that this new partnership will be beneficial for the team. Bidwill believes that Bally’s experience in the industry will help the Cardinals improve their game-day experience for fans.

This new partnership comes at an important time for the Cardinals, as they prepare for their move to a new stadium in 2018. The team is hoping that this will be an opportunity to improve their lackluster performance in recent years.

Since joining the NFL in 1988, the Cardinals have only made it to the playoffs four times. In fact, they haven’t had a winning season since 2008. With a new stadium on the horizon and a new manufacturer of slot machines, the Cardinals are hoping for a better future.
