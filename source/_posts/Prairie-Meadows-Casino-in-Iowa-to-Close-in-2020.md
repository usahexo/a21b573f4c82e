#  Prairie Meadows Casino in Iowa to Close in 2020

After news of the closure of the Prairie Meadows Casino in Iowa came to light, employees and gamblers alike were devastated. In a letter to employees, casino management cited financial reasons for the closure, which is set to take place at the end of 2020. This leaves many people wondering what will become of the roughly 650 jobs that will be lost in the area.

The Prairie Meadows Casino has been a mainstay in Altoona, Iowa since it first opened its doors in 1989. At its peak, the casino employed over 1,200 people. But with increasing competition from other casinos in the state - and a general decline in casino revenue - the decision was made to close up shop.

This is certainly bad news for locals who relied on the casino for employment, but it's also bad news for the economy as a whole. The Prairie Meadows Casino had an annual economic impact of $128 million,according to The Des Moines Register. That's a lot of money that will now be missing from the local economy.

It's unclear what will happen to the property once the casino closes down. There's a possibility that it could be turned into something else - like a shopping center or office park - but nothing has been announced as of yet.

In the meantime, employees are trying to come to terms with the fact that they might be out of a job soon. Many of them have been with the casino for years, and they're not sure what they'll do next. "I'm 60 years old and I've been here since Day One," one employee told The Des Moines Register. "I don't know what I'm going to do."

The closure of Prairie Meadows Casino is certainly a blow to the local economy, but hopefully something can be done to offset some of those losses before 2020 comes around.

#  Rival Casinos Threaten to Close Prairie Meadows Casino in Iowa

The state of Iowa may soon see the closure of one of its Native American casinos, as two rival casinos have threatened to shut down Prairie Meadows Casino in Iowa.

The Prairie Meadows Casino is owned and operated by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, who have been in a long-standing dispute with the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska over casino revenue sharing. The Winnebago Tribe operates the White River Casino, just across the border from the Prairie Meadows Casino.

In a letter sent to Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, representatives from the White River Casino claim that they will close their casino if the Prairie Meadows Casino is not shut down. “It’s time for you and your administration to take sides,” the letter reads. “If you don’t enforce the law and shut down Prairie Meadow’s illegal casino, we will be forced to close our business and lay off 125 employees. This will devastate our local economy.”

The Poarch Band of Creek Indians has disputed these claims, stating that they are in compliance with all state and federal laws. They also argue that the White River Casino is not blameless in this dispute, as they have been accused of violating gaming regulations themselves.

This conflict is just one example of the growing tension between tribal casinos and commercial casinos in states that have both types of gambling establishments. In many cases, commercial casinos argue that tribal casinos have an unfair advantage because they are exempt from some gaming regulations.

Governor Reynolds has not yet stated which side she will take in this dispute, but she has warned that any closure of the Prairie Meadows Casino would have a negative impact on the state’s economy.

#  Changes Afoot for Popular Prairie Meadows Casino in Iowa

The future of one of Iowa's most popular casinos is in question after the state's gambling commission voted this week to not renew the casino's license. The Prairie Meadows Casino in Altoona, just outside of Des Moines, has been in operation since 1991 and is one of the most profitable casinos in the state.

The decision to not renew the casino's license came as a bit of a surprise to many, as the casino has been a model for responsible gambling and has had a good relationship with the commission. But commissioners say that changes are needed in order to keep up with new competition from neighboring states.

Prairie Meadows Casino employs over 1,200 people and is responsible for more than $100 million in annual revenue for the state of Iowa. It's not clear what will happen to those employees or to the casino itself if it is forced to close.

#  State of Iowa Mum on Future of Troubled Prairie Meadows Casino

DES MOINES, Iowa -- While the state of Iowa has yet to comment on the future of Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino, industry insiders say they believe the facility's days are numbered.

The casino has been in financial trouble for years and its chairman recently resigned after being indicted on federal corruption charges.

Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds says her administration is still exploring all options for the property, but some believe that means a sale is inevitable.

"I don't think there's any other option," said one industry insider who asked not to be identified. "It's just hemorrhaging money."

Prairie Meadows was once a crown jewel of the Iowa casino industry, but its fortunes have taken a turn for the worse in recent years. The casino has failed to turn a profit since 2013 and its debt has ballooned to more than $300 million.

In June, its former chairman, Warren Buffett protege Marty Music, resigned after being indicted on federal corruption charges. He's accused of steering casino contracts to friends and business associates in exchange for gifts and campaign contributions.

Buffett himself is no stranger to the casino, having personally invested more than $400 million in it over the years. He's also faced his share of legal troubles there; in 2015, his company Berkshire Hathaway agreed to pay a $900,000 fine to settle allegations that it manipulated Prairie Meadows' stock prices.

Governor Reynolds says her administration is still exploring all options for the property, but some believe that means a sale is inevitable. "I don't think there's any other option," said one industry insider who asked not to be identified. "It's just hemorrhaging money."

#  Uncertainty Reigns as Future of Prairie Meadows Casino Hangs in the Balance

Des Moines, Iowa - The future of the Prairie Meadows casino is up in the air as the state government mulls over what to do with the facility.

Since it opened in 1990, Prairie Meadows has been a key contributor to the state's economy, generating more than $2 billion in revenue. But with increasing competition from neighboring states and a new tax on casinos proposed by the Iowa legislature, the future of Prairie Meadows is uncertain.

Governor Kim Reynolds has not yet said whether she supports closing Prairie Meadows, but she has acknowledged that the state faces difficult decisions when it comes to the casino. "The bottom line is that we have to make sure that we're looking at all our options and that we're being smart about what we're doing," Reynolds said.

Prairie Meadows officials say they are committed to working with the state to find a solution that benefits both parties. "We understand that there are challenges facing the state budget, and we want to be part of the solution," said Dean Rhoads, CEO of Prairie Meadows. "We're hopeful that we can find a way to keep Prairie Meadows open and continue contributing to Iowa's economy."

The fate of Prairie Meadows will likely be decided in the coming months as lawmakers debate the proposed casino tax.
