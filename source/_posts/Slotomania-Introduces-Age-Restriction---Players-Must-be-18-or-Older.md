#  Slotomania Introduces Age Restriction - Players Must be 18 or Older

Slotomania, one of the most popular online casino games, has announced that it will be introducing an age restriction policy. Players must now be at least 18 years old in order to play the game.

This new measure is in line with other online casinos and is meant to protect players from potential risks associated with gambling. Slotomania is committed to providing a safe and fun experience for all of its players, and this new policy is one way of ensuring that.

Slotomania is one of the most popular online casino games, with over 10 million active players. With this new policy in place, it is hoped that even more people will be able to enjoy the game in a safe and responsible manner.

#  Slotomania Tightens Player Regulations with Age Requirement

Slotomania, one of the most popular online casino games, announced that it is implementing a new player regulation that requires all players to be at least 18 years old. The change went into effect on January 1, 2019.

The new age requirement is intended to better protect players and ensure that only those who are legally able to gamble are doing so. Slotomania joins several other online casinos in implementing this policy.

Many people applauded the move, including one parent whose underage child had been playing the game. She said, "I'm really happy that they're doing this. It makes me feel a lot better about letting my son play because I know that he's going to be safe and that there are more protections in place."

Others, including some Slotomania players who are now too young to continue playing, lamented the change. One such player said, "It's kind of harsh because I've been playing for a while now and I'm not really happy about it."

Despite some complaints, the overwhelming majority of players seem to be in favor of the new age requirement. And with good reason - it helps keep players safe and ensures that only those who are legally allowed to gamble can do so.

#  Slotomania Updates Terms of Service - Players Must be 18 or Older to Play

As of January 1, 2018, Slotomania will be updating their terms of service to require all players to be 18 years or older in order to play. This change is being made in compliance with the new GDPR regulations that are set to take effect later this year.

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a set of regulations that are designed to protect the privacy of digital data and information. The regulation applies to any company that processes or stores the data of EU citizens, regardless of whether the company is based inside or outside of the EU.

Slotomania has been working hard to update their systems and procedures in order to be compliant with the GDPR. This includes making changes to their terms of service in order to ensure that all players are over the age of 18.

Slotomania is not the only company making these changes - many other online gaming companies are also preparing for the GDPR. In fact, Facebook has already announced that they will be suspending all data-sharing agreements with many third-party companies in order to comply with the GDPR.

So what does this mean for Slotomania players? Basically, if you are under 18 years old, you will no longer be able to play at Slotomania or any other site that falls under the jurisdiction of the GDPR. You may still use Facebook and other social media sites, but you will not be able to share any personal data with them (or any other third-party company).

This may seem like a bit of a inconvenience, but it is important that we all do our part in ensuring that our personal data is protected. The GDPR provides us with much-needed protections against identity theft and other online scams. So while it may take a bit more effort on our part to ensure compliance, I think we can all agree that it is worth it!

#  Slotomania Adds Age Restriction Following Complaints from Parents

Slotomania, a popular social casino game with millions of active users, has announced it is introducing an age restriction following complaints from parents. From now on, players must be at least 21 years old to access the game.

The move comes after several parents contacted Slotomania parent company Playtika to complain about their children being able to access the game. One mother said her 10-year-old son had managed to spend $1,000 on the game in just a few hours.

“It’s irresponsible for these games to be targeting kids and not having any restrictions in place,” she said. “My son was begging me for money to play and I had no idea how much he had already spent until I got an email from Playtika telling me he’d blown through $1,000 in just a few hours.”

Others complained that the game was addictive and caused children to neglect their school work and other responsibilities.

In response, Playtika said it was introducing an age restriction “in order to ensure that only adults have access to our games.” Players must now provide identification verifying they are over 21 in order to continue playing Slotomania and other Playtika games.

#  Slotomania Removes Age Restriction Following Complaints from Players

Slotomania, a popular Facebook game with over 10 million users, has removed its age restriction following complaints from players.

The game, which is free to play but offers in-game purchases of virtual currency, was previously restricted to players aged 13 and over. But following complaints that the age limit was preventing younger children from playing the game, the restriction has now been removed.

In a statement on its website, Slotomania said: "We have heard your feedback and have decided to remove the age restriction for our game. Slotomania is now open to all ages!"

The decision was welcomed by many players, who took to social media to express their joy. "Finally! My six-year-old can start playing his favorite game," wrote one player on Facebook.

Others welcomed the move but raised concerns about child safety. "It's great that they've lifted the age limit but parents need to be careful about what features their kids are using in the game," wrote another player.

Slotomania is not the only Facebook game with an age restriction. Other popular games such as Farmville and Candy Crush Saga also have restrictions in place, usually requiring players to be aged 13 or over.
