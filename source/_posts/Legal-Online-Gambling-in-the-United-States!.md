#  Legal Online Gambling in the United States!

Online gambling has been around for over two decades, but it has only been in the last ten years that it has become a major industry. In this time, jurisdictions around the world have grappled with how to legislate and regulate the industry. But what about the United States? How does online gambling work in the US, and what are the current laws?

The first online casino opened in 1994, and online poker became popular soon after. At this time, there were no specific laws regulating online gambling. However, in 2006, Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA), which prohibited banks from processing payments to and from online gambling sites. This effectively killed the US online gambling market.

In 2011, state regulators in Nevada began issuing licenses for online poker sites. Other states followed suit, and in 2013 the Department of Justice issued a memo clarifying that states could license and regulate online gambling within their borders. This led to a resurgence of interest in online gambling in the United States.

Today, there are three types of jurisdictional approaches to regulating online gambling: prohibition (illegal), authorization (legal under specific conditions), and permissive (legal). The US takes a prohibitionist approach, meaning that all forms of unlicensed online gambling are illegal. However, there is some ambiguity about what falls under the definition of “unlicensed” internet gambling. For example, fantasy sports leagues may be considered illegal if they include real money betting on outcomes, but many people consider them games of skill rather than chance, which would make them legal.

There are a few licensed casinos and poker sites operating in Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. These states have enacted specific laws authorizing such sites. Residents of other states can access these sites but cannot gamble on them if they are not located in one of the authorized states. There are also numerous offshore operators who accept players from all over the US; these operators are not licensed or regulated by any US jurisdiction.

So what happens if you live in a state where online gambling is prohibited and you decide to gamble on an unlicensed site? You could be subject to criminal penalties including jail time and fines. However, prosecutions for unlicensed internet gambling are relatively rare; most players who engage in this activity likely don’t realize that it’s illegal or don’t think they will get caught.

#  Delaware and Nevada Join Forces to Offer Legal Online Gambling

In a move that could signal the start of a new era in online gambling, Delaware and Nevada have announced a partnership that will allow residents of both states to gamble on the internet.

The deal is seen as a win-win for both states, which are looking to boost their economies by drawing in new gamblers. It is also seen as a way to bring more money into state coffers, as taxes on online gambling can be significant.

Officials in both states believe that the partnership will be successful, and they are already making plans to expand it to include other states in the near future.

Residents of both states were quick to express their excitement about the news, and many said that they would be taking advantage of the new opportunity as soon as possible.

"I've been waiting for something like this for a long time," said one Nevada resident. "I'm definitely going to be playing some slots online."

"This is great news for Delaware," said another resident. "I can't wait to start playing poker online."

While there are some who worry that the increased availability of online gambling will lead to addiction and other problems, most people seem to believe that it is a safe and enjoyable way to spend some free time. And with more and more states looking to get involved, it seems likely that online gambling will only continue to grow in popularity.

#  New Jersey to Allow Atlantic City Casinos to Offer Online Gambling

On October 25, 2017, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that allows casinos in Atlantic City to offer online gambling to players located in the state. The new law goes into effect on November 26, 2017.

Under the new law, casinos in Atlantic City will be able to offer online gambling through their websites and mobile apps. Players will be able to gamble on casino games such as slots, blackjack, and roulette. The minimum age for gambling online is 21.

Players will be able to place bets on games of chance and skill-based games. Skill-based games are games in which the player’s odds of winning are based on their skills, rather than chance.

Online gambling will be taxed at a rate of 13 percent. This is in addition to the taxes that casinos already pay on their gaming revenues.

Atlantic City casinos have been struggling financially in recent years, and this new law is hoped to help them turn around their fortunes. In July 2017, casino revenues in Atlantic City were down by nearly 25 percent from the same month the year before.

#  California legalizes online poker

On October 15, 2018, the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, signed into law Assembly Bill (AB) 1463 whichlegalizes and regulates online poker in the state. This makes California the fourth US state after Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey to legalize and regulate online poker.

The new law will come into effect on January 1, 2019. It will allow Californian residents to play online poker at licensed and regulated websites. The law also establishes a framework for the licensing and regulation of online poker operators in California.

AB 1463 was sponsored by Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer, a Democrat from South Los Angeles. It passed through the California Assembly and Senate with bipartisan support. In a statement following the signing of the bill, Assemblyman Jones-Sawyer said:

"This is an important day for California as we finally provide a regulatory framework for safe and legal internet poker. This has been a long time coming and I want to thank all of my colleagues in the Legislature who supported this effort."

Online poker is expected to generate around $180 million in annual revenue for California, which will be used to fund public programs such as education and healthcare.

#  Pennsylvania becomes fourth state to legalize online gambling

In a continued effort to legalize gambling, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf has announced that online gambling will be legalized in the state. This makes Pennsylvania the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling.

The bill, which was first proposed in February, was passed by the House on Wednesday with a vote of 149-46 and now heads to the Senate for a final vote. The measure would allow people over 21 years of age in the state to gamble on casino games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette, from their homes or phones.

Governor Wolf said in a statement: "This legislation will help Pennsylvania become a national leader in gaming innovation while ensuring that our citizens have access to safe and responsible gaming options. This is an important step forward to provide new opportunities for Pennsylvanians and generate much-needed revenue for education and property tax relief."

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased addiction rates and expose people to scam artists. But supporters say that it will create jobs and bring in much needed revenue to the state.

If the measure is passed by the Senate, it will go into effect 30 days later.
