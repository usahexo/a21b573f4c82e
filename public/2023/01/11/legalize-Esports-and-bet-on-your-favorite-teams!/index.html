Games such as DOTA 2, League of Legends, and CS:GO have millions of fans all around the world, and with good reason – they’re incredibly fun to play and watch.</p>
<p>As Esports continue to grow, it is only natural that lawmakers take notice and consider ways to legalize and regulate the industry. After all, betting on Esports is already a multi-billion dollar business, and new laws could only enrich everyone involved even further.</p>
<p>Here in the United States, lawmakers are currently debating how to best legalize Esports betting. Several bills have been introduced in Congress, but no clear consensus has yet been reached. One thing is for sure, however – lawmakers are taking notice of this rapidly growing industry and are working hard to create a legal framework that will benefit everyone involved.</p>
<p>In Europe, things are moving a bit more quickly. Earlier this year, the UK Gambling Commission released a report stating that they were prepared to license Esports betting websites. This was seen as a major step forward for the industry, as it legitimized Esports gambling in the eyes of many regulators.</p>
<p>So why should you care about all of this? Simple – because legalized Esports betting means that you can now legally bet on your favorite teams and players! This adds an extra level of excitement to watching your favorite games, and it also opens up some new investment opportunities.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in getting into Esports betting, there are several websites where you can do so. Check out Unikrn for example – they offer bets on a wide variety of games and feature some of the best odds in the business. Or alternatively, check out Pinnacle Sports – they offer competitive odds on almost any matchup you can think of.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Start browsing these websites today and start making some informed bets on your favorite Esports teams!</p>

The latest news in the world of esports betting is that DraftKings, one of the world’s foremost fantasy sports platforms, will soon be accepting bets on esports matches.</p>
<p>This is huge news for the industry, as it opens up Esports betting to a much wider audience. Previously, if you wanted to bet on an esport, you would have needed to go to a specialised site such as Unikrn. This new development from DraftKings means that there will be a major betting platform for esports available in most countries around the world.</p>
<p>What this means for the industry as a whole is difficult to say, but it can only be good news. With more money being invested into esports, and with big names like DraftKings getting involved, we can expect even bigger and better things from the world of competitive gaming. So far in 2017 alone we have seen some amazing tournaments, such as The International 7 (a DOTA 2 tournament with a prize pool of over $20 million) and ELEAGUE Major: Boston (a CSGO tournament with a prize pool of over $1 million).</p>
<p>It is clear thatDraftKings taking an interest in esports is a major vote of confidence in the industry. This could be the start of something truly great, as more people are drawn in by the excitement and drama of competitive gaming. With top-level players becoming celebrities in their own right, it’s not hard to see why interest in esports is growing at such a fast pace.</p>
<p>If you want to get in on the action and start betting on your favourite esport matches, then you need to head over to DraftKings and sign up today! There are already several esport contests available, so you can start betting straight away. Who knows – maybe you could be the next big winner in the world of esports betting!</p>
<h1 id="don’t-miss-out-on-the-newest-way-to-bet-on-Esports"><a href="#don’t-miss-out-on-the-newest-way-to-bet-on-Esports" class="headerlink" title="don’t miss out on the newest way to bet - on Esports!"></a>don’t miss out on the newest way to bet - on Esports!</h1><p>Esports has been taking the world by storm and is only growing in popularity. The excitement of Esports comes from the competitive, tense atmosphere that is created when gamers from around the world compete against each other.</p>
<p>This popularity has caught the attention of online sportsbooks, who are now offering odds on Esports matches. This provides a great opportunity for those looking to get into betting on Esports.</p>
<p>There are a few things you need to know before getting started betting on Esports. First, make sure you understand the different types of bets that are available. The most common type of bet is the moneyline bet, where you simply choose which team will win the match.</p>
<p>Another common type of bet is the point spread bet. In this type of bet, one team is given a handicap (usually a points margin) and you must choose whether that team will cover the handicap or not. There are also other types of bets available, so make sure you understand all of them before placing any bets.</p>
<p>Second, do your research on the teams and players involved in each match. This will give you a better idea of who is likely to win and help you make sound betting decisions. You can find information about teams and players online or by talking to others who follow Esports closely.</p>
<p>Finally, always gamble responsibly and never bet more than you can afford to lose. Gambling should be fun, so make sure you are only betting what you can afford to lose without it impacting your day-to-day life negatively.</p>
<h1 id="Esports-betting-coming-to-a-stadium-near-you"><a href="#Esports-betting-coming-to-a-stadium-near-you" class="headerlink" title="Esports betting: coming to a stadium near you!"></a>Esports betting: coming to a stadium near you!</h1><p>While esports betting is nothing new, the increasing popularity of the activity has seen it move more into the mainstream in recent years. And with this move into the mainstream has come a desire by traditional sportsbooks to offer esport betting as well.</p>
<p>This was highlighted recently when Bet365, one of the world’s largest online sportsbooks, announced that they were expanding their offerings to include esports. This comes on the back of a growing demand by customers for such betting opportunities.</p>
<p>According to research by Goldman Sachs, the global market for esports is expected to grow from $493 million in 2016 to $1.5 billion in 2020. So it’s not surprising that traditional sportsbooks are looking to get in on this growing market.</p>
<p>But what exactly is esports? And why is it becoming so popular?</p>
<p>Esports is competitive gaming and has been around for many years. However, it has only recently started to gain traction as a spectator sport, with people watching others play games online or in stadiums.</p>
<p>The games that are typically played in esports tournaments include League of Legends, DOTA 2, CS:GO, Halo 5 and Counter Strike 1.6 (yes, there was a time when Counter Strike was insanely popular). There are also tournaments for amateur gamers who often play less popular games like Hearthstone and Rocket League.</p>
<p>The reason esports is becoming so popular can be attributed to a few things. Firstly, video games have become more mainstream over the past few years and this has helped to fuel the growth of esports. In addition, the rise of live streaming services like Twitch has helped to propel esports into the mainstream.</p>
<p>People can now watch their favourite gamers play live and this gives them a level of excitement and engagement that you don’t get from watching traditional sporting events. Finally, many professional gamers have become quite famous and this helps to attract attention to the sport.</p>
<p>So why is Bet365 getting involved? Well, as mentioned earlier, there is a growing demand from customers for such betting opportunities. In addition, Bet365 want to be seen as a “one-stop shop” for all your gambling needs and they feel that offering esports betting will help achieve this goal.</p>
<p>As someone who follows both traditional sports and esports, I think it’s great that Bet365 are getting involved. It will give me another avenue through which I can place bets on my favourite teams/players and hopefully increase my chances of making some money!</p>
