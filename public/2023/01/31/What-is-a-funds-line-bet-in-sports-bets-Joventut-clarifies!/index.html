Joventut clarifies!"></a>What is a funds line bet in sports bets? Joventut clarifies!</h1><p>A money line wager is a variety of bet where you select which group will win the game outright. Unlike point spread bets, money line bets do not factor in the margin of victory or defeat. Which means that a team that is favored to win by 7 points - would still pay out the same amount as a team that was favored by only 1 point.</p>
<p>The payout for a money line bet is always stated as either positive or negative number. This number represents the amount of money that can be won on a $100 wager. So, for example, if there was a -150 odds for one team and a +130 odds for the other - this would mean that $150 could be won on a $100 wager on the favorite, while $130 could be won on a $100 wager on the underdog.</p>
<p>Conversely, if there was a +150 odds for one team and a -180 odds for the other, this would mean that $180 could be won on a $100 wager on the favorite, while only $150 could be won on a $100 wager placed on the underdog.</p>

Joventut explains!"></a>How do I make a funds line bet in sports bets? Joventut explains!</h1><p>Making a funds line bet in sports is definitely an interesting technique to wager on your favorite team.

<p>Now, it is critical to note that these odds are constantly shifting based on how significantly money continues to be wagered on each side. So if far more money comes in for the Patriots than the Eagles, the odds will shift and favor New England even far more.
